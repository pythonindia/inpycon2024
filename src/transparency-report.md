## Code of Conduct

### Introduction

PyCon India 2024 is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment
for all participants, regardless of their background, experience, or identity.
Our Code of Conduct (CoC) is designed to ensure a safe and respectful conference
experience for everyone. This transparency report documents any CoC-related
incidents and outlines the actions taken by the organizing team.

### Reporting Process

We take all CoC violations seriously and had a clear reporting process in place.
Attendees could report incidents via multiple channels, including:

- In-person to designated staff
- Through a dedicated email

All reports were reviewed and handled by our dedicated CoC Response Committee.

### CoC Response Team
- Members: 7

### Proactive Measures

Based on feedback from PyCon India 2023, we took specific steps to prevent
inadvertent breaches of our CoC policies:

- We trained our AV vendor in advance to avoid displaying any religious symbols
during the event.
- The AV setup was reviewed and confirmed to be free of religious symbols before
the conference began.

### Incidents

- **Ongoing Investigation**: One report, related to a previous edition of PyCon
India, is currently under active review by the CoC Response Team. To ensure a
fair and thorough process, we are unable to share specific details at this time.
We are committed to following up with all involved parties, and a summary will
be published in a future update once the matter is resolved.

- **During the 2024 Event**: No CoC violations or incident reports were received
during the event.

We remain committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all
participants. We are grateful to those who help uphold our community standards
and encourage continued feedback to strengthen our processes. If you have any
suggestions regarding the Code of Conduct or reporting mechanisms, please
contact us at **coc@in.pycon.org**.

We hope that PyCon India 2024 was a positive and enriching experience for
everyone, and we look forward to welcoming you again in the future.

## Accessibility & Child Care

PyCon India 2024 focused on making the conference more inclusive and accessible
for all attendees. Key initiatives included:

- **Closed Captions**: All recorded talks included closed captions, helping
participants follow content more easily in a format that suits their needs.
- **Visual Aids**: Sessions featured adapted doodles and illustrations to make
complex ideas more engaging and memorable.

To support caregivers and make the conference more accessible to parents, we
introduced on-site child care services for the first time. The service was
provided free of charge and staffed by trained professionals from a certified
agency. It was available throughout the event and included age-appropriate
activities and quiet rest areas.

While the pilot was positively received, we recognize that improvements are
needed for future editions. We have shared detailed feedback with upcoming
organizing teams to help evolve this service further.

The PyCon India team is dedicated to continuously improving accessibility and
child care offerings, and we welcome new ideas to make the conference experience
better for everyone.
