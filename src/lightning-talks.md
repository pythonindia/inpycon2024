## What's a Lightning Talk?

Lightning talks are short presentations, limited to 5 minutes, on any topic that might interest the Python community. It doesn't have to be something you've created, feel free to share something you've learned or a technique you think others will find useful.

- Is there something at work that everyone asks for your help with? Talk about that!
- Did you recently learn something that made a difference for you? Talk about that!
- Is there a topic you've always wanted to understand better? Talk about that!

Slides are optional but encouraged!

## Things people say when they think they can't do a lightning talk

- **"Everyone already knows THING_X"**
    - No, they don't.
    - They believe they are knowledgeable, but you possess a deeper comprehension of the subject matter. They will gain valuable insights through this interaction.
    - Even if they do, it's interesting to hear someone else's take on it.
- **"Iâ€™m not an expert at anything"**
    - You know more than you think you do.
    - You don't have to be an expert, you just have to be interested enough to talk for 5 minutes.
    - You can do a 1-minute lightning talk if you want.
- **"It's scary talking in front of people"**
    - Yes, but you will feel really accomplished when you've done it.
    - Folks at PyCon are super-friendly and are always welcoming of new speakers.
    - It is understandable that public speaking can induce nervousness in individuals, including those who may appear confident.
    - [You can give a lightning talk without talking!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aio0whC1iYg#t=25m58s)
- **"I have an idea but it's no good"**
    - It's a better idea than you think.
    - Are there really any bad ideas for lightning talks? :)
