PyCon India 2024 Scholarships is a need-based scholarship for Speakers, Students, or Attendees to attend PyCon India.

Scholarships will be provided after reviewing the needs of the attendees and the impact generated. A panel of reviewers will assess each request and approve the grants. Applicant information will be kept confidential.

Scholarship recipients will receive Travel and Accommodation support for attending the conference.
