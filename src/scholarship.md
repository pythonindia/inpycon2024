PyCon India 2024 Scholarships is a need-based scholarship for Speakers, Students, or Attendees to attend PyCon India.

Scholarships will be provided after reviewing the needs of the attendees and the impact generated. A panel of reviewers will assess each request and approve the grants. Applicant information will be kept confidential.

Scholarship recipients will receive Travel and Accommodation support for attending the conference. The travel grant will be based on two-way 3AC train journey fare and hotel accommodation amount equivalent to 3 nights. The maximum amount admissible is INR 10,000. The mode of payment for the grants will be communicated to respective recipients on selection and will be approved on providing actual invoices. We recommend that attendees book their Travel and Accommodation anyway instead of waiting for the selection notification.
