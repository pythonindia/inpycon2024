# PyCon India 2024: Fostering Diversity and Inclusion

*This page will be regularly updated with new information and resources. We invite you to visit it frequently to stay updated on our accessibility initiatives.*

PyCon India 2024 is not just a conference; it's a community where every voice is valued and celebrated. We believe that diversity and inclusion are fundamental pillars that make the Python community vibrant, innovative, and welcoming. Our goal for PyCon India 2024 is to create a space where everyone, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to learn, share, and grow in a supportive environment.

## Why Diversity and Inclusion Matter at PyCon India

The strength of the Python community lies in its diversity. We recognize that diverse perspectives bring unique insights and creativity, driving innovation and problem-solving. By fostering an inclusive culture, we aim to provide an equitable platform where everyone feels comfortable, empowered, and valued.

At PyCon India 2024, we are committed to creating an environment that encourages participation from people of all races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, abilities, socioeconomic statuses, religions, and cultures. This is not just about compliance but about building a thriving community where every individual has the chance to contribute and benefit.

## Our Initiatives to Promote Diversity and Inclusion

To ensure that PyCon India 2024 is a welcoming experience for all, we are implementing several initiatives:

### Scholarships
We will provide scholarships to individuals from underrepresented groups who might otherwise face financial barriers to attending PyCon India. This includes support for conference registration, travel, and accommodation for students and others.

### Networking Opportunities
We will host various networking events and sessions designed to facilitate interactions among attendees from different backgrounds. These activities will help build lasting connections, share knowledge, and celebrate the diversity that makes the Python community so special.

### Child Care
We understand that one of the challenges parents face while attending conferences is arranging child care. PyCon India 2024 is providing an on-site child care service to support parents and guardians. This initiative ensures that parents can fully participate in the conference activities, knowing their children are safe, engaged, and well cared for.

### PyLadies Lunch at PyCon India 2024
We are happy to host the PyLadies Lunch at PyCon India 2024, a special event for women and gender minorities in the Python community. This lunch is a chance to meet, share experiences, and connect in a friendly setting. It is a great way to find support, learn from others, and talk about topics that matter to you. We invite all women and gender minorities at PyCon India 2024 to join us and be part of a community that values diversity and inclusion in tech.

## How You Can Get Involved

Your participation and support are crucial in making PyCon India 2024 a truly inclusive event. Here are some ways you can get involved:

### Mentorship Program

Our mentorship program was designed to support all members of our community, whether they were speaking or submitting a workshop for the first time or seasoned speakers looking for feedback. This year, we successfully provided mentorship to many speakers, helping them refine their slides, improve their presentation skills, and deliver impactful talks and workshops at PyCon India 2024.

We reached out to industry professionals and experts who have delivered multiple talks and workshops at various conferences, covering the proposal categories mentioned in our Call for Proposals (CFP). These categories included Python in Platform Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Python on Hardware, Community, Core Python, Python in Education and Research, Python in Web and Applications, and more. Based on these categories, we identified suitable mentors and scheduled sessions to support speakers in need of guidance.

If you’re interested in becoming a mentor in the future, keep an eye out for our next call for mentors. You can apply by filling out the mentorship form with your experience and details. Our mentorship team carefully reviews these applications to onboard individuals who can help build a supportive learning environment for our community, ensuring that every speaker has the tools and confidence needed to succeed.

### Volunteers
Help us make PyCon India 2024 an event where everyone feels welcome and included. Volunteering is a great way to give back to the community and make a positive impact.
